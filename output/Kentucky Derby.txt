Archived from the original on May 1, 2018. Sire lines[edit] the Darley Arabian (1700c) sire line 
has produced 128 Derby winners (120 colts, 5 geldings, 3 fillies), including all winners from 
1938 to present. The three races offered large purses, and in 1919 Sir Barton became 
the first horse to win all three races. Two years after the term went in 
use, the race (until that time ran in mid-May since inception) changed the date to 
the first Saturday in May. The store is open during the spring, September, and fall 
race meets, from gate opening time to 30 minutes after the last race. In 1968, 
Dancer's Image became the first horse to win the race and then faced disqualification. Although 
the races do not record times for non-winners, in 1973 Sham finished second, two and 
a half lengths behind Secretariat in the same race. Another sub-two-minute finish, only the third, 
was set in 2001 by Monarchos at 1:59.97, the first year the race used hundredths 
of seconds instead of fifths in timing. However, most Churchill Downs patrons sip theirs from 
souvenir glasses (first offered in 1939 and available in revised form each year since) printed 
with all previous Derby winners. Festival[edit] Main article: Kentucky Derby Festival In the weeks preceding 
the race, numerous activities took place for the Kentucky Derby Festival.
